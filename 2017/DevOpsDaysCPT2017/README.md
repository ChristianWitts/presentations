## Abstract

No distributed system is safe from failures, and neither is your organisation. Is it possible to extend the CAP theorem to people and gain a Consistent, Available, and Partition Tolerant workforce in the face of disparate levels of leadership, anachronisms, and a million priorities ?

## Post-conference retrospective

While the talk didn't go badly, I certainly learnt that preparation is key to success. Only finishing my slides and notes a few minutes before needing to start talking meant I was unable to do a dry run, and not knowing how long the talk would run for. Luckily it ran ~35 minutes which was long enough, but I certainly would have re-ordered slides a little (most notably, slide 20 The 5 Levels of Leadership, which should have come before Some Tactics to Employ in order to speak on how each level can play their part in the changes required for success).

A good resource to use to prepare better in future, is [Matthieu Napoli's Speaker Checklist](http://mnapoli.fr/speaker-checklist/) which I will use as a reference going forward.
